# Abstract
The integrated concept of “smart cities” has emerged as a key focus of contemporary research, yet efforts remain fragmented, split between technology-driven and human-centered approaches. This study leverages open data and large language models to analyze smart city research proposals funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) in the U.S. and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC). Our findings reveal common scientific inquiries alongside divergent research trajectories shaped by national contexts, exposing a persistent tension between techno-centric priorities and human-oriented imperatives. This comparative analysis of two leading global economies provides new insights into the evolution of smart city research, highlighting both shared challenges and distinct pathways.
